Iris flowers dataset is one of the best dataset in classification literature. The classification of iris flowers machine learning project is often referred to as the “Hello World” of machine learning. The dataset has numeric attributes and beginners need to figure out on how to load and handle data. The iris dataset is small which easily fits into the memory and does not require any special transformations or scaling to begin with.

Iris Dataset can be downloaded from UCI ML Repository

 The goal of this machine learning project is to classify the flowers into one of three species – virginica, setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals.
 
 If you're a beginner, you'll find some strange names in the notebook(don't freak out). These are ML Algorithms. Here are some videos willl help you build some intuition:
 
 -Logistic Regression (LR): sigmoid function

 -Linear Discriminant Analysis: Creates a new axis and projects the data points on it in  a way that maximizes the seperation between classes

 -Classification and Regression Trees (CART)

 -Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) : Bayes theorom tells you how much you should trust the evidence, by calculting the posterior probabilitie.

 -Support Vector Machines (SVM): Great for high dimensional spaces, Memory efficient
